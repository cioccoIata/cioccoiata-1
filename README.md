 ⛤🩸 . Buyer Beware
   * JJBA is my main interest, I will talk about it a lot.
   * I love Cioccolata, he is my BF irl. No, I'm not gonna get upset if you like him too he's just a drawing.
   * I do kin and sometimes I dislike doubles, but I'm very flexible and typically won't care if you don't brag about it.                                                                                                
That being said, if you kin Diavolo [JJBA] please do not interact.
      * I consider my kins to be me irl. I will call them me irl. If this upsets you then feel free to hide me. 
   * I am mostly AFK/Off-Tab, whispers are best to get a reply from me. Don't be afraid to chat, I love conversation!
   * I don't mind anybody sitting with me or my friends, I won't yell at you for doing it like most people do.
